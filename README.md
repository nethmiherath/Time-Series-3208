Course Code: MAT 3208

Subject: Time Series  

Course Description / About this Course:                                                                                                   
The analysis of real-world data that have been observed at different time points leads to unique problems in statistical modeling and inference. The time series analysis explains about specific ways of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time. This course will introduce modern time series analysis techniques and theories which could use to model real-world applications.

Learning Objectives:
By the end of the quarter, students should be able to:

Understand the elements to classical decomposition

Understand how to use ACF and PACF to identify orders of ARMA(p,q) models for time series data

Apply appropriate diagnostic measures to identify any shortcomings in model assumptions

Understand how to use information theoretic methods and cross validation for model selection

Understand how to combine state and observation models into a state-space model

Use multivariate time series models with covariates to identify influential explanatory variables and do perturbation analyses

Use Dynamic Factor Analysis to identify common patterns among many time series

Use Dynamic Linear Models to allow for changing relationships between a response variable and any explanatory variable(s)
